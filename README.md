I'm KeezoP and this is my github account. Here i've stored most of the work that i have done over the last year.
Given time, i would reiterate on certain individual projects to improve their code strucure and functionality.

About Me:
Iâ€™m interested in coding and playing games. On weekends i also play card games like yu-gi-oh. 
All of these aspects contain various levels of problem solving which i enjoy greatly.
