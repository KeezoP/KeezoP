Welcome to my github account. 

Here i've stored most of the work that i have done over the last year as part of my Masters Degree.

In order to meet deadlines, some code is rather inefficient, especially the WetWare Project.
This was mainly due to time constraints whilst also balancing multiple projects

Given time, i would reiterate on certain individual projects to improve their code strucure and functionality.
